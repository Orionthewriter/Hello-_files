# Overview

I have created this and a series of projects to demonstrate the range of coding that I have worked on in the past

This page refers to a "Hello World" project written in my language of choice being C.


[This](https://youtu.be/akvfbFHUtgI) is the demo!

## Development Environment

This project was written in Visual Studio Code using multiple c/c++ extensions.

I utilized the C language because it is a legacy language that teaches certain structural things, such as mains, that are lost in noncompiled code such as python. It also sets the precedent for working wiht compiled code.
